# SLaW.ScrapLearnAndWatch

Langs/Libs:
Ruby, Sinatra, AngularJs, Html, Css;
Apache Spark: Core, Ml.

Past:
Many year ago I wrote a scraper for a content I needed to be automaticly fetched.
I wrote that in bash, with a few Linux tools.

Present:
I want to write a WebBased App that will do the same, but:
I'll have Web UI to add mine sugestions to AI
I'll have AI in Apache Spark to learn what content I prefer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO:

-. move DB part as REST api, at first bash logic will do all but
    REST api will take DB part
    in bash part this is done in three different steps, so:

 -) DB/REST for Newst Content

 -) DB/REST for Choosen Content Base URLs

 -) DB/REST for Choosen Content to be fetched

-. basic UI // add more

-. Automate // add more
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Done:

+. prapare project
